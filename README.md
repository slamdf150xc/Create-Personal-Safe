# Create-Personal-Safe

This script can create a single safe or you can provide a .csv file to bulk creation.

The .csv file for bulk creation will need to have four headers

- Name

The name of the privileged account that needs to be added to the safe.
- Privileged Account

The domain that the privileged account is a member of. (EX: cyberarkdemo.com)
- Domain

The directory map in CyberArk that the non-privileged user is associated with.
